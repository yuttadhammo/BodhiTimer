About
=====

Bodhi Timer is an elegant, minimalist countdown timer.  It is designed mainly for use as a meditation timer but can easily be used for any similar purpose.  

Set the time via the clock icon in the top left.  You may set presets by choosing a time then holding down on one of the three preset buttons.

You may alternatively use speech to set the time by long-pressing the clock button.  (These behaviours can be swapped via the preference screen.) To set multiple timers using speech, separate using the word "again", as in "five minutes again ten minutes"

Pause / resume via the button in the bottom left, and stop the timer via the button in the bottom right.  The top right button is the preference button.  

You may add a timer widget to your desktop via the App Drawer, or on your lockscreen (Android 4.2+).

Animation may be toggled between an image and one of four circle animations, chosen from the preferences screen.

Bodhi Timer is based on the free and open source TeaTimer by Ralph Gootee:

It uses Android's built-in notification system to trigger the alarm, which means it works even when your device is asleep.
