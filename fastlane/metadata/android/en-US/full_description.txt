🔷 Set the time via the clock icon in the top left. You may set presets by choosing a time then holding down on one of the three preset buttons.
🔷 Pause / resume via the button in the bottom left, and stop the timer via the button in the bottom right. The top right button is the preference button.
🔷 Animation may be toggled between an image and one of four circle animations, chosen from the preferences screen.
🔷 It uses Android's built-in notification system to trigger the alarm, which means it works even when your device is asleep.
